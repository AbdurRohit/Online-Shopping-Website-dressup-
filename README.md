This is an online shopping website, that contains all the mentioned categories of products. 
How to use =>
1. Clone the repo
2. Import the MySQL database (install JDBC connectors to connect the databases)
3. Run index.html using the Eclipse runtime environment.
4. Now all set. You are ready to go.

The technology used here is JSP (Java Servlet Programming).
It's an outdated and complicated technology I would recommend not cloning it in case you want your brain-cell
fried.
